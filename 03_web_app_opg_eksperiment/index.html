            Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher, and esports tournament organizer based in Los Angeles, California. 
            It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games
            and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. 
            Its publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversaw the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers until its shutdown in January 2024.

            <h1>League of Legends</h1>
                League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
                Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. 
                Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. 
                The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
                In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. 
                Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. 
                In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

            <div>
                Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. 
                The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team 
                to be the last one standing. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android 
                and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.

                <h1>Valorant</h1>
                Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games. 
                The game's development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in October 2019. 
                A closed beta period began with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. 
                It was originally designed for Windows only, but support for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 was added in June 2024, 
                albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, 
                spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.
